Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she went for a walk by the river with her mommy. 

As they walked, they saw a big tree leaning over the river. "Look, mommy!" Lily said. "The tree is leaning over the river!" 

"Yes, it is," her mommy replied. "It's leaning because the ground is soft from all the rain we've had." 

Lily looked at the tree and saw the light shining through the leaves. "It's so pretty," she said. 

"Yes, it is," her mommy agreed. "The sunlight makes everything look so bright and beautiful." 

Lily smiled and continued to walk, happy to have seen something new and exciting.

Tom and Lily were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to smell the herbs that grew there, like mint and rosemary. They liked to see the sun shine on the flowers and the bees. They liked to hear the birds sing and the wind blow.

One day, Tom and Lily saw a new herb in the garden. It was tall and green, with purple flowers. It smelled sweet and spicy. They wanted to touch it and taste it, but they did not know what it was.

"Let's ask Mom," Tom said.

"No, let's try it ourselves," Lily said. "It looks yummy."

Lily picked a leaf and put it in her mouth. She made a face and spat it out. "Yuck! It's bitter and hot!"

Tom laughed. "You're silly, Lily. You should not eat things you don't know."

Lily felt angry and sad. She wanted to make Tom feel bad too. She saw a shiny red berry on the herb. She picked it and gave it to Tom. "Here, try this. It's sweet and juicy."

Tom trusted Lily. He took the berry and bit it. He felt a pain in his mouth and his throat. He dropped the berry and cried. "Ow! Ow! It hurts! It burns!"

Lily saw Tom cry and felt scared. She did not mean to hurt him. She wanted to help him, but she did not know how. She ran to the house and called Mom.

Mom came and saw Tom. She saw the herb and the berry. She knew what they were. They were poison. She was very angry and very worried. She took Tom to the car and drove to the hospital.

Lily stayed in the garden. She felt lonely and sorry. She wished she had not given Tom the berry. She wished she had listened to him. She wished they were still friends. She cried and cried. The sun did not shine for her anymore.

One day there was a young girl named Sarah. She was walking through the park with her mum when she saw something that made her stop in her tracks. In the distance, there was a big tree with lots of bright red cherries on it. She pulled on her mothers hand and pointed at the tree, saying that she wanted to get one. 

Her Mother smiled and told her she could, but that they would need to go home first to get a basket. After picking up the basket from their house, they walked back to the park. 

Sarah was very happy. She raced to the tree and stretched her hands up to pick the closest one she could reach. But when she pulled her hand back the cherry was gone, leaving a branch full of empty stems where it had been. 

Sarah was sad. She looked at her mum and asked what had happened. Her mum simply smiled, reached into her pocket, and pulled out the same bright red cherry that Sarah had pointed at earlier.

Sarah was amazed. She asked how her Mum had known where to find the cherry, but her Mum just kept smiling. If Sarah had only realised earlier, she could have had the cherry much sooner!

Tim and Sam were best friends. They liked to play with their toys in the garden. One day, they found a big box in the shed. It had a button that said "shrink". They wondered what it did.

"Let's try it on this teddy bear," Tim said. He put the teddy bear in the box and pressed the button. The box made a loud noise and a bright light. When Tim opened the box, the teddy bear was very small. "Wow, it works!" Tim said. "This is so cool!"

Sam wanted to try it too. He grabbed his toy car and put it in the box. He pressed the button and waited. The box made the same noise and light. When Sam opened the box, his toy car was also very small. "Look, my car is tiny!" Sam said. "This is fun!"

They decided to shrink more things. They shrunk their balls, their books, their hats, and their shoes. They laughed and played with their small things. They did not notice that the sun was going down and it was getting dark.

"Let's shrink ourselves!" Tim said. "Then we can play with our small things better!"

"OK, but how do we get big again?" Sam asked.

"Easy, we just press the button again," Tim said. He did not know that the button only worked once.

They climbed into the box and pressed the button. The box made the noise and the light. They shrunk to the size of ants. They tried to press the button again, but they were too small. They could not reach it.

They screamed for help, but no one heard them. They were scared and cold. They saw a big shadow coming towards them. It was a cat. The cat saw them and licked its lips. It pounced on them and ate them. The end.

He tapes them together and makes a door and a window. He cuts out a triangle for the roof and tapes it on top. He is very proud of his building and puts it on his table.

He wants to make more buildings, but he runs out of paper. He looks around his room and sees his books. He thinks they are like paper, but thicker. He takes one of his books and opens it. He sees many words and pictures, but he does not care. He starts to cut out pieces of the book with his scissors.

He does not hear his mom coming into his room. She sees Tom cutting his book and the building on his table. She is very angry and sad. She takes the scissors and the book away from Tom. She tells him that books are not for cutting, but for reading and learning. She tells him that he has to say sorry and fix his book. She also tells him that he has to clean up his mess and put away his toys.

Tom feels bad and says sorry to his mom. He tries to fix his book, but it is too hard. He cries and hugs his mom. He tells her that he loves her and he loves his books.

One day, Lily's mom came into her room. She saw the candle on the floor. She was angry. "Lily, why do you have a candle in your room? You know candles are not for playing. They are for light and heat. They can burn you or start a fire. Give me the candle now."

Lily did not want to give her the candle. She loved her candle. She said, "No, mom, it is my candle. I want to play with it. It is not a regular candle. It is a magic candle. It can make wishes come true."

Lily's mom did not believe her. She tried to take the candle from her. Lily held on tight. They pulled and pulled. The candle broke in half. Lily and her mom gasped. Lily started to cry. She said, "Mom, you broke my candle. You broke my magic. How can I fix it?"

Lily's mom felt sorry. She hugged Lily and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to break your candle. I was just worried about you. Maybe we can repair it. Do you have some glue or tape?"

Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and said, "Yes, mom, I have some glue in my drawer. Can we glue it back together?"

Lily's mom said, "Yes, we can try. Let's go get the glue and see what we can do. Maybe your candle will still work. Maybe it will still be magic."

Lily smiled. She said, "Thank you, mom. I love you. And I love my candle."

They went to get the glue and tried to repair the candle. They put it on the table and lit it. It still burned and smelled nice. Lily made a wish and blew it out. She hoped her wish would come true. She hoped her candle was still magic.

Lily and Ben were playing in the kitchen. They wanted to make a cake for Mom. They found some flour, some eggs, some milk and some sugar. They put them in a big bowl and started to stir.

"Stir, stir, stir!" Lily said. "We are good cooks!"

"Yes, we are!" Ben said. "But the cake is not pink. Mom likes pink. How can we make it pink?"

"Look, Ben! Now it is pink!" she said.

Ben smiled. "You are smart, Lily! Let's put it in the oven!"

"What have you done?" she yelled. "You could have started a fire! You could have hurt yourselves! You are in big trouble!"

She took them out of the kitchen and put them in their room. She did not give them any cake. She did not hug them or kiss them. She did not say she loved them.

So, the mouse hopped out from behind the rock and hopped over to the bee. The bee saw the mouse and asked it why it was out of hiding.

The mouse replied, "I was hiding, but then I saw you looking for food and I wanted to help. I'm so small that I can hide in places that you can't."

The bee was so happy and thanked the mouse. It said, "With your small brain and quick hiding skills, I'm sure we will find food in no time."

The bee and the mouse continued their search together and eventually found lots of food. The bee was so thankful and the mouse was glad that it had helped. From then on, they remained friends and the mouse kept an eye out for the bee whenever it needed help hiding.
